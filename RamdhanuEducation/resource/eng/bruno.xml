		<title>Friendly Bruno</title>
		<text>
Bruno, the small rat, lived with his mother in a burrow. Every morning, his mother went in search of food. 
“Bruno, close the door, and stay inside.”Mother rat said as usual before she went.
Bruno replied, “OK, mom. Bye.”
After sometime, Bruno felt bored sitting at home all by himself. He came out. Bruno saw a little red bird sitting on the tree.
“Hello birdie. Will you play with me?” Bruno asked.
The bird replied, “No, I have to collect grains for my babies.” Then she flew away. Bruno moved ahead, and saw a colony of ants.  
“Hello ants. Will you play with me?” Bruno asked.
The ants replied, “No, We have to collect foot.”
Then Bruno saw a butterfly. But she flew away without talking to Bruno. Bruno became very sad.
“I have no friends,’ he said unhappily.
Just them, two baby squirrels came up to him.
One of them told him, “Hello, my name is Rio and this is my brother Pio. Will you be our friend?”
Bruno was very happy. He held the squirrels’ hands and shouted, “Hurrah! I have made two good friends.
We will chat, learn and play every day.”
In the evening, their mothers were happy to see them playing together.
