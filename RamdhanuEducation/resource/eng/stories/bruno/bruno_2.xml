After sometime, Bruno felt bored sitting at home all by himself. He came out. Bruno saw a little red bird sitting on the tree.
“Hello birdie. Will you play with me?” Bruno asked.
The bird replied, “No, I have to collect grains for my babies.” Then she flew away. Bruno moved ahead, and saw a colony of ants.
